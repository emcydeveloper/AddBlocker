              So you’ve heard of frontend and backend development and what they
              involve, but what is a full-stack developer, what do they do, and

              you.

              In this post, I’m going to be giving you both the wider scope and
              some of the details of what this sought-after job entails and my
              experiences within the field. Hopefully by then, that should
              answer that sticky-note question for both novices and more
              experienced coders alike. Essentially, we’re going to learn what
              is a full-stack developer, and how you can become one.

            <h1>1. What is t-shaped developer?</h1>
            <p>
              The T-shaped model is a concept that has been around for a while
              that describes the abilities or characteristics of an individual.
              An ideal T-shaped person has many generalized skills, with a
              specialization in one or a few specific fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              A full-stack web developer is an excellent example of this model,
              as the developer has general knowledge across a wide breadth of
              technologies and platforms as well as in-depth experience and
              specialization in a couple of those concepts. For the most part,
              there are two general fields that make up a full-stack developer’s
              skillset: frontend development and backend development.

            <h1>2. What is frontend web development?</h1>
            <p>
              This skillset involves the actual presentation of your website—how
              the information in your website is laid out in browsers and on
              mobile devices as well. A dedicated frontend developer will be
              very experienced working with HTML and CSS, as well as the
              scripting language JavaScript. With these languages, the developer
              can very efficiently manipulate the information on a website to
              make it appealing and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything that you actually see on a website—the layout, the
              positioning of text and images, colors, fonts, buttons, and so
              on—are all factors that the frontend developer must consider.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main goal of a frontend developer is to
              <strong>provide the platform for visitors to interact with</strong
              >, a platform which provides and receives information. This means
              some developers will be well-versed in web design and using
              software such as Photoshop and Illustrator to create graphics and
              themed layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additional skillsets of a frontend developer could include user
              experience design and user interface design, skills which help a
              team evaluate the best methods of displaying and collecting
              information. A frontend developer who possesses these design
              skills is potentially more valuable as they can identify the look
              and feel of a site while assessing the technical capabilities of
              such a design at the same time.

            <h1>3. What is backend web development?</h1>
            <p>
              Creation, edit/update, and collection of data are some of the
              processes that are most often associated with backend development.
              Some examples of common scripting languages used are
              <strong>PHP, Ruby</strong>, and the most popular these days,
              <strong><u>Python</u></strong
              >. With these languages, a backend developer can create algorithms
              and business logic to manipulate the data that was received in
              frontend development.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that a backend developer must be able to write code to
              receive the information input from the user and also save it
              somewhere–like in a database. There are two main types of
              databases:
              <strong>relational</strong> (like PostgreSQL and MySQL) and
              <strong>non-relational</strong> management systems (like Mongo).
              The language used for database management is SQL, which helps the
              developer interact with the database.
            </p>
            <p>
              The concepts might sound foreign, but just understand that there
              are different database management systems based on convenience and
              use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another component of backend development is
              <strong>server management</strong>, which are applications that
              host the database and serve up the website. An alternative to
              knowing how to manage servers is to use
              <strong>cloud-based platforms</strong> that provide the
              infrastructure, like Heroku or Amazon Web Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding server management allows a developer to troubleshoot
              slow applications and even determine how scalable their websites
              are to include more users.

            <h1>4. What is a full-stack web developer?</h1>
            <p>
              Full-stack developers are experts in both the frontend and
              backend; so, the full-stack of technology that makes up a website.
              They are proficient in both frontend and backend languages and
              frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting
              environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge, most full-stack
              developers will have spent many years working in a variety of
              different roles. They also tend to be well-versed in both business
              logic and user experience, meaning they are not only well-equipped
              to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.

            <p>
              Given the choice to specialize in frontend or backend development,
              why would any developer choose to learn the full spectrum?
            </p>
            <p>
              It goes back to the value of being a T-shaped person. You are more
              valuable to a team when you are able to address and discuss both
              aspects of the web development process and bridge the disconnect.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, one developer who can readily assess and
              communicate how a website should look, feel, and manipulate data
              while understanding the technical limitations of such
              implementations will be a respected and valuable member of any
              team or company.

            <h1>6. Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
              There are many resources available to learn about full-stack web
              development. Google the phrase “become a full-stack developer” and
              you will get pages and pages of different venues and methods to
              learn. But you’re probably at the start of the journey and don’t
              feel like you have the knowledge to differentiate between the
              self-guides, YouTube videos, bootcamps, and online courses.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good first tip is to review the resources based on a criteria of
              the topics mentioned in this article. Ask yourself questions like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How much frontend development is involved?</li>
              <li>What will I learn for backend development?</li>
              <li>
                What programming languages and frameworks are being taught?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A full-stack developer has all the keys to the house–there is no
              door that you cannot open. It provides an unparalleled freedom to
              simultaneously work on frontend and backend development and
              evaluate the capabilities and potential of your website in
              real-time without having to wait for another developer to review
              if what you’re desiring is possible or not.
